Reasoning:

- Have the pathfinding and movement client sided because the server is capable of verifying whether the player position is valid. The movement should be sent to the server when animation is done and calculated (in the future) for accuracy.

- The combat is based on each entity, and thus it allows full control over what that entity does, removing the need to have to parse through every entity in the world.
