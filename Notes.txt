Kaetram To-Do List:

- Move ornament to Vars.css
- Finish basic tile-map rendering
- Begin moving all CSS to Sass
- Begin entity-rendering and distribution of sprites (scales accordingly)


- Get proper button interfaces for "Login," "New Character" and "Back."
- Directly download map data from the server.


- Music areas will be handled server sided - we must take as much load off the client as possible.
- Redo the map? Re-arrange the map?

- Change Enum to Enum.toString() for animations
