- Finish basic tile-map rendering
- Begin moving all CSS to Sass
- Begin entity-rendering and distribution of sprites (scales accordingly)

- Get proper button interfaces for "Login," "New Character" and "Back."
- Directly download map data from the server.

- When game is in a fully playable state, separate client packets from server packets.
- Add 'extra' to parsing of tiles

Finished:

- Convert the getPlayerData(player) method from MySQL to be directly inputted into
  query(``, {}); ✓
- Automate the MySQL database selection and creation process. ✓
