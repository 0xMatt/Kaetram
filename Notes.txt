Kaetram To-Do List:

- Begin moving all CSS to Sass

- Get proper button interfaces for "Login," "New Character" and "Back."
- Directly download map data from the server.

- Save player orientation upon logout.

- Centre properly inside buildings

- Implement range in combat styles

- Review combat and test out PvP
- Format combat code and smoothen it out (take as many things out of incoming.js)

- Loading other information from MySQL
- Determine what to save to the MySQL

- Have combat sync up from other's perspectives (pushToOthers)
- Implement projectiles and ranged combat

- Add the info manager from TTA

Finished:

- Convert the getPlayerData(player) method from MySQL to be directly inputted into query(``, {}); ✓
- Automate the MySQL database selection and creation process. ✓
- Music areas will be handled server sided - we must take as much load off the client as possible. ✓
- Move ornament to Vars.css ✓
- Add 'extra' to parsing of tiles ✓
- Use underscore for rendering ✓
- Fix the third scale ✓
- Finish basic tile-map rendering ✓
- Begin entity-rendering and distribution of sprites (scales accordingly) ✓
- Fix spam click attack ✓
- Implement auto-retaliation ✓


Reasoning:

- Have the pathfinding and movement client sided because the server is capable of verifying whether the player position is valid. The movement should be sent to the server when animation is done and calculated (in the future) for accuracy.

- The combat is based on each entity, and thus it allows full control over what that entity does, removing the need to have to parse through every entity in the world.
